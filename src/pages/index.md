    #     We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
    #     That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
    #     space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
    #     coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
    #     sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
